/**
(1)	Species Dynamics
<ul>
<li>Value 0: Full species dynamics. Not recommended.
<li>Value 1: No species dynamics. Species percents in TPH and BA are constant.
<li>Value 2: Limited dynamics. Percents by BA are constant, but TPH %’s vary.
</ul>
(2)	Maximum Breast Height Age
<ul>
<li>Value 0: No upper age for application of BA and DQ yield equations.
<li>Value n: Maximum BH age for application of BA and DQ yields is 100 * n (years).
</ul>
(3)	Basal Area Growth Model
<ul>
<li>Value 0: BA growth comes from fiat model (approach to yield eqn’s).
<li>Value 1: BA growth from empirical model (older ages suspect).
<li>Value 2: Mixed fiat & empirical model. (See SEQ111 and IPSJF162).	
</ul>
(4)	Maximum Breast Height Per Species and Region
<ul>
<li>Value 0: Will default to (2). Controls upper bounds in some models.
<li>Value 1: Limits from SEQ108 on control file, categorized by GRPBA1.
<li>Value 2: Limits from SEQ043 on control file, Coast Interior & Leading species. 
</ul>
(5)	Messaging Level. See note (1), below
(6)	Quadratic Mean Diameter growth model
<ul>
<li>Value 0: DQ growth comes from fiat model (approach to yield eqn’s).
<li>Value 1: DQ growth from empirical model (older ages suspect).
<li>Value 2: Mixed fiat & empirical model. (See SEQ117 and IPSJF178).	
</ul>
(8)	Lorey Height change strategy
<ul>
<li>Value 0: Normal changes in Lorey height (HL), all species.
<li>Value 1: Force change to zero for nonprimary species if change in HD is zero.
<li>Value 2: Force change to zero for all species if change in HD is zero.
                           (option 2 precludes changes in primary sp HL due solely to change in TPH).
</ul>
(9) Can limit BA if DQ has been limited (see Note 2, below.)
<p>
(11-21)	HD/Age/SI fill-in controls (see Note 3, and IPSJF174.doc).
<p>
<b>Note 1</b>: for all programs the 5th debug switch should be zero except for program debugging. This will 
prevent “SZERO” messages in the output and error messages produced by the MATH77 routines. Allowable 
values:
<ul>
<li>Value 0: activates the MATH77 process to suppress messages AND furthermore totally deactivates the 
messaging capability.
<li>Value 1: implements the MATH77 deactivation mechanism, but there will still be a few error messages.
<li>Value 2: allows for normal error messaging.
</ul>
The usual underlying cause of the messages is that in reconciling results for the different species, the 
program has been forced to violate a DQ/HL limit for a species. 
<p>
<b>Note 2</b>: There has been a programming change to VDYP7 GROW, such that the behavior of the BA increment 
may be altered subsequent to a projection having hit or exceeded a DQ limit. The configuration file 
for VDYP7 GROW is affected, in that on sequence 199, Ndebug(9) is now defined. 
<ul>
<li>Value 0: causes the program to operate as it always has to date (2009.03.24)
<li>Value 1: causes the indicated condition to be checked for, and may cause some predicted BA increments 
to be smaller, or to be set to zero.
</ul>
An explanation of the change, and the reason for it, are given in a document JFmemo_20090311.doc. Detailed 
notes for code developers and those with detailed knowledge of VDYP7 are in JFmemo_20090318.doc.
<p>
<b>Note 3</b>: Valid values from Ndebug(11) through Ndebug(20):
<ul>
<li>0: No action  
<li>1: Move SI from non-primary to primary using sitetools si conversions. Checks start with second high-BA 
       species, then ordered by ISP. If no conversions found, first attempted conversion redone 1:1.
<li>2: Move SI from primary to non-primary using sitetools si conversions.
<li>3: Complete  (TOTAGE, BHAGE, YTBH) if 2 out of 3 present, all sp.
<li>4: Move total age from non-primary to primary species (From second-most common species if present, else 
       1st encountered).
<li>5: Estimate dominant height of primary species from Lorey height.
<li>6: Estimate dominant height of non-primary species from Lorey heights.
<li>7: Estimate SI of primary species from HD and total age. (*)
<li>8: Estimate SI of primary species from HD and BHAGE.  (*)
<li>9: Estimate SI of non-primary species from HD and total age. (*)
<li>10: Estimate SI of non-primary species from HD and BHAGE. (*)
<li>11: Estimate ages (total and BH and YTBH) of primary species from SI, HD
<li>12: Estimate ages (total and BH and YTBH) of non-primary species from SI, HD.
<li>13: Estimate YTBH of primary species from SI.
<li>14: Estimate YTBH of non-primary species from SI.
<li>15: Same as option 1, condition on total age (primary) < 30.
</ul>
